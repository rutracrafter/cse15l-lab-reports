# Lab Report 3
I have chosen the `find` command to learn more about.

## Find with `-type` flag
We can use the -type flag to specify whether we want to look for file or directories. For searching for files only, use `-type f`, and for searching for directories, use `-type d`.

Example 1:
```
[cs15lwi23asd@ieng6-201]:skill-demo1-data:284$ find written_2/ -type f
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.txt 
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch14.txt
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch15.txt
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch2.txt 
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch3.txt 
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch6.txt 
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch7.txt
