\
Once here, you should select your account for this course, which will be done by clicking the button that has "cs15lwi23zz" where the zz is a placeholder that represents the characters at the end that are specific to your account. \
\
After clicking on that box, you will be taken to a page where you can manage your different UCSD accounts' passwords. It is up to you if you want to change all of your passwords to the new one, or if you only want to change the password to this specific account.\
\
After making your decision, follow the instruction given on that page to continue and finish the password change process. \
\
**NOTE:** Sometimes even if you leave the global password change box deselected, there is a chance that all of your passwords will be changed to the new one anyway, just be aware that this is something that can and has happened to some people. \
\
**IMPORTANT: IT CAN TAKE AROUND 15 MINUTES FOR THE PASSWORD CHANGE TO COME INTO EFFECT** \
\
You are now done setting up your UCSD account credentials!

# Installing VSCode
Now we need to [download and install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode for short). \
\
Once you click the above link, you will be taken to the VSCode home page where you can click the big blue download button to begin the download. \
\
**Note:** Make sure that you download the correct VSCode version for your Operating System (Windows, MacOS, Linux)! \
\
Now, once the download is done, double click the executable file to begin the installation process. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. \
\
Once that's done, you should be able to open VSCode and be brough to a window that looks like this: \
